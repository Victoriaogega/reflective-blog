        <h1>Finding Yourself</h1>
<p> I would rename the book finding myself because I see the journey of Trevor Noah as he tries to fit in and wondering why he is different until he found out who he wanted to be. <br> At one time, he even asks his mother why they never went to Germany because other white kids had told him that they went to Germany because of the apartheid. He thought that if he had gone to Germany, he would fit in without the struggle he was going through in their country. </p>

<p> In school he was confused as to where he should go during break because students  were classified according to colour and he did not fit to either of the extremes. He was too light for the blacks and he was too black for the whites. In the process he learned to use language as he had observed his mother do. He found out that language more than skin can be used to define who you are. He used to speak the Xhosa, English,Zulu and  Afrikaans. He used to talk to the students in their languages and as a result students started interacting with him and this made him less of an outsider. </p>

<p>Through his interaction with the black students he realized that he wanted to be black as compared to being mixed or white. Even when the school insisted that he should stay with the white people he fought to stay with the black students. He accepted the fact that the only way he could interact with the females was through being funny and he was comfortable with this. With time he gained confidence after his acne wore off. </p>

<div class="question">
    
    <p> <i> "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… <br>  but he never fell in love with subservient women… <br> 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”</i></p>
</div>
    <p>The quote resonates with relationship expectations in today's society because some men  choose to marry women who are independent and free spirited just to make them submissive and exercise their power over them. The sole reason they go after such women is because they want to make them change to what the society expects and not because they love them. This is what attracts them to a woman and this is also the reason why they cannot go for the already submissive women; they want to change the women to be submissive to them and break their beliefs so that they can conform to societal expectations. </p>
        <p> At first the men will praise the independence, ambition and intelligence of the women and once they are together, they would start talking against the same things they were praising. They would start verbal abuse as a joke which would sometimes develop into physical abuse. They would even go ahead and tell them to stop working so that they can take care of the kids at home and they expect the woman to obey without any question. </p>
        
      <p>  This brings in the gender roles associated with women. The women according to the society are supposed to  be submissive and obedient to the husband. They are also expected to stay at home with the kids, do all the cleaning and the laundry while the man is at work. The men on the other hand are believed to be the head of the family and so they expect whatever they say to be followed with no questions even when it is not favouring the wife. He does not take into account what the wife wants. At some instances the woman becomes so dependent on the man that she cannot leave him and ends conforming to  the society.
